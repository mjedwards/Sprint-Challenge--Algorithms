## Exercise I

a) logarithmic O(log n)


b) Linearithmic O( n log n)


c) linear O(n)

## Exercise II


f story or greater and egg dropped == egg broken.

story less then f and egg dropped == egg not broken.

determine what floor I am on and if it is equal to f or greater and I drop an egg that will return a broken egg. If the floor I am is less than f floor and I drop the egg then it will return an egg not broken. Something like a binary search where I find the middle of a list and find if my current floor is greater than or less, then I would go left or right and that will produce a result. I think there will be a iteration involved in this process, so if it is a for loop that would equate to a linear O(n) the time would be dependent on the size of "building".
